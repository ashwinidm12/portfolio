                My journey in software development began with HTML and CSS, but
                it was when I learned JavaScript and the power of{" "}
                <strong>React</strong> that my passion for web development truly
                ignited. I specialize in building scalable and performant web
                applications with a strong focus on user experience and clean,
                maintainable code.

                Currently, I am 6th sem student, as a part of a collaborative team 
                projects, including an{" "}
                <strong>e-learning platform</strong> built using the MERN stack.

                When I'm not developing web applications, you’ll find me
                fine-tuning my motorcycle, exploring off-road trails, or
                organizing spaces to create a productive environment. I also
                enjoy occasional pencil sckeching ,with good company and dabble in SEO
                and UI/UX research to stay informed on modern digital trends.
